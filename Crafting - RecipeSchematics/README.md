## 7 Days 2 Die Modlet

Have you ever found a weapon mod, but wished you had the schematic for it instead? Well, now you can!

Using the table saw, some paper, glue, and leather you can turn that mod into a schematic of the same type!

Of course, in order to make the schematic, the original mod will be consumed in the process, but you'll have a
shiny new schematic to read!

Not to mention, you will finally have a good use for that table saw you just _had_ to have, but now sits in your crafting area collecting dust.

Special Thanks to Steveburger (aka Khar Brons) for his help and ideas on this modlet!
